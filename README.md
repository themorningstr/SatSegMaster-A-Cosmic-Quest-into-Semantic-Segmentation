# SatSegMaster-A-Cosmic-Quest-into-Semantic-Segmentation


This project is based on Semantic Segmantation On satellite Imagery Data.

Following Details About Project
1. Dataset used to perform this task is an open source [PASTIS](https://zenodo.org/record/5012942) (29 GB zipped) : The original PASTIS dataset for semantic and panoptic segmentation
on Sentinel-2 time series (format used for the [ICCV 2021 paper](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2021/papers/Garnot_Panoptic_Segmentation_of_Satellite_Image_Time_Series_With_Convolutional_Temporal_ICCV_2021_paper.pdf)).
